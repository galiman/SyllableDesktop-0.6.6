Syllable will now be installed onto your hard drive.  This will take a few
minutes.  Once the installation is complete, you will be asked a few more
questions so that your Syllable installation can be correctly configured.

WARNING: If you reboot or turn off your computer while Syllable is being
installed, the installation will be corrupt and you most likely will not be
able to boot your Syllable installation.
